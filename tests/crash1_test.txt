### Sign Language Recognition Application Tests

#### Test Description:

1. **Database Connection Test**
   - Objective: To ensure the correctness of establishing a connection with the database.
   - Description: This test verifies whether the `create_connection` function correctly establishes a connection with the local MySQL database.
   - Expected Outcome: The connection to the database is successfully established.

2. **Database Initialization Test**
   - Objective: To ensure that database tables are created successfully.
   - Description: This test checks whether, after running the `init_db` function, the `subscription_plan`, `users`, and `payments` tables are present in the database.
   - Expected Outcome: Tables are created successfully.

3. **Reset Recognized Count Test**
   - Objective: To verify the functionality of the function resetting the recognized signs count for users.
   - Description: This test ensures that the `reset_recognized_count` function correctly resets the recognized signs count for users with Basic and Standard plans.
   - Expected Outcome: The recognized signs count is reset for the appropriate users.

4. **Revoke Drop Privileges Test**
   - Objective: To ensure that drop database privileges are revoked for unauthorized users.
   - Description: This test checks whether the `revoke_drop_privileges` function correctly revokes drop database privileges for users other than root and MySQL system user.
   - Expected Outcome: Drop database privileges are revoked for the appropriate users.

5. **SocketIO Image Handling Test**
   - Objective: To ensure the correctness of the function handling image transfer via SocketIO.
   - Description: This integration test verifies whether the application correctly handles image transfer via SocketIO. Currently, the test is empty and requires implementation of the function handling this functionality.
   - Expected Outcome: The application handles image transfer via SocketIO correctly.
